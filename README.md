# Airbnb Data Prediction

## Summary
This study utilizes various data analysis and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of an Airbnb listing based on various factors such as location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and reviews.

## Programming Languages
The analysis is conducted using programming techniques applicable in both **R and Python** environments.

## Methods
The core statistical method used in this project is **Linear Regression**. This approach is selected for its effectiveness in predicting outcomes based on linear relationships between variables.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizes visualization and statistical analysis to explore the data and uncover insights.
- **Modeling:** Employs Ridge Regression, Ridge Regression, and multilevel model to predict Airbnb prices, focusing on the relationship between various features and the target variable.
